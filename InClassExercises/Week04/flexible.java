     * Golomb Industries is designing their new office building following modern
     * principles that allow for flexible, reconfigurable meeting spaces. Their
     * plans include a very wide rectangular room, with a series of optional
     * parallel partitions.
     * 
     * \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth ]{example}
     * Figure 1: An example of a configurable space
     * Figure 1 illustrates such a room having a width of 10 units and three
     * optional partitions located 1 unit, 4 units, and 8 units away from the left
     * wall of the room. The width of the room always measures the distance between
     * the left and right walls, and partitions always run parallel to these walls.
     * We do not concern ourselves with the depth of the room.
     * 
     * For this example, if no partitions are used, a meeting can be held in the
     * original space having width 10. If the company needs a space that is
     * precisely 4 units wide, they can use the portion of the room between the left
     * wall and a partition placed at location 4 (or they could use the portion
     * between the partitions at locations 4 and 8). To provide a space having width
     * 7 they can use the portion of the room between the partitions placed at
     * locations 1 and 8 (omitting the partition at location 4).
     * 
     * Given a particular room design, your job is to determine all feasible widths
     * for a meeting.
     * 
     * Input
     * The first line of the input contains two integers: the overall width
     * of the room, with
     * , and the number
     * of intermediate partitions, such that
     * . Following that is a line with
     * integers, each designating the location
     * of an optional partition, such that
     * . Each partition is at a distinct location and the partitionsâ€™ locations will
     * be listed in increasing order.
     * 
     * Output
     * Your program should output a list, from smallest to largest, of each distinct
     * width that can be achieved for a meeting space.
