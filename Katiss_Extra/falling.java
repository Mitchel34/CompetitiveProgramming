     * Falling Mugs Problem
     * 
     * 
     * Susan is makiing high-speed videos of falling coffee mugs. when alayzeing the
     * videos she wants to know how big the mugs are, but unfortunately they all go
     * destroyed during filming. susan knows some physics though, she has figured
     * out how far the moved between different video frames. the camera was filmeing
     * at a speed of 70 frames per second, which means that a frame n, counted from
     * when the mug was released, the number of millimeters it has moved is d = n^2.
     * The countingn of the frames starts at 0. Susan thinks a certain mug is D
     * militmeters high, but to verify theis she needs to find two frames between
     * which the mug has moved exactly this disntace,. Can you help her do this?
     * 
     * Input: The input file contains the single positive intefer D <= 200000, the
     * distnace to be measured.
     * 
     * Output: Output two non-negative integers n1 and n2, the numbers of the frames
     * that Susan whould compare. They should fulfill n^2(2) - n^2(1) = D. If no two
     * such integers exist, instead outut "impossible".
